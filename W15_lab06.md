# W15_lab06 cs56-games-name-memorization Observations

================

-What kind of JUnit tests could we make to test if the game works as it should be? I feel like the only way to test a game is actually by playing it.

-Should have a test target in the build.xml if junit is to be developed.

-Some buttons don't do anything, probably because they were in the process of being implemented.

-The game currently +1 point for every correct card and -1 for incorrect. There should be a way for the game to sort correct and incorrect cards so that the player can view incorrect cards, memorize them, and play the game again to get those cards correct.

-If all cards were played, it should say something like "end of deck."
Maybe add a counter.

-Cards could be randomly ordered when playing.

-The clean target in build.xml should delete Decks.ser (?)

-Implement new deck button and make it functional.
