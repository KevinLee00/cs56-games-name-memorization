W14 | andrewberls | Anthony Hoang and Colin Biafore | Ã… name memorization game


 When the game starts up it loads the deck that was created the last time the program was ran.
 The program allows the user to add a card and edit the front and back of the card. Once
 the card is added, the screen updates to the added card. At the bottom of the window are show
 front/back buttons that allow you see what is on the back or front side of the card. At this
 stage of the project, the user can choose to upload a picture to the front side of the card,
 but not for the back. The future aims of the program is to have the ability to choose what deck
 the cards are being chosen from and to allow the user to create more decks. The ability to keep
 track of which card the user is able to  memorize is another addition that this memorize application
 should be able to do. There would be a button that the user can press to indicate if he got it wrong
 or right and would be based on the honor system, since the program is not designed to let people type
 in their answers.
